Automates a game of Teamfight Tactics (WIP).

Utilizes screen capturing and character and image recognition (with openCV and pytesseract, and PIL) to determine current game states.
AI algorithm decides best set of actions using simulated key presses based on perceived state.

Next steps: Enhancing complexity of AI algorithm and accuracy of observable game state to improve decision making.
